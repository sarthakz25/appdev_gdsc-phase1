Task is to create UX Flow Diagram of an app for my college campus.
```

```
So for this app I havee designed a main UX Flow Diagram with the Flow Diagrams of 16 different pages for a college app.
```

Pg1 (Login) - Here the user will have to enter sap id and password if his/her account already exists and if the username and password matches the user will be logged into the app.

Pg2 (Signup) - If the user doesn't have an account he will be redirected to this page in which the user has to enter his/her sap id, email id, new password which should match the criteria and reenter the password which should match to the new password if all conditions are true then the user successfully logs into the app or else user will be asked to repeat a step again.

Also i forgot to mention if the user doesnt remember his/her password he/she will get a forgot password option on the login/signin page which will allow them to reset the password.

Pg3 (Home) - This is most important page of this app because from login/signup the user will come here. This page contains 7 buttons dashboard, news/updates, about, admission, support, profile, signout. Clicking or pressing these buttons will take the user to indivisual pages for each button except sign out which will take the user back to login page asking he/she to login again into the app.

Pg4 (Menu) - This is another important page of this app because this provides the user with 4 butttons - assignments, marks(ICA), study resources(ebooks) and support. Like earlier these buttons will also take the user to the indivisual button pages.

Pg5 (Dashboard) - This is once again an important page of this app but not as important as the early two because this page has 2 buttons while other two had more buttons than this. Those 2 buttons are - Attendance and News and updates.

Pg6 (Support) - This is the support page of the app where user gets two buttons - mail or call. Clicking on these 2 buttons gives user 2 mails and numbers respectiverly so as to contact the support.

Pg7 (About) - This page shows info about the college. There's also a navigate button at the bottom which will take the user to the location page.

Pg8 (Location) - This page shows an image of where the college is which its nearby localities. Then theres a address mentioned of the college and a navigate button which will take the user to the maps app according to the mentioned address and which would further help him/her navigate to the college.

Pg9 (Study Resources or ebooks) - This page contains all the ebooks/study resources. It has 2 dropdowns - Select Semester and Select Subject. Once the user chooses his/her options from the dropdown various resource books a displayed to the user with data on which it has been uploaded. It provides a user friendly downlod system as resource book is displayed in form of a button which when clicked/pressed downloads that particular resource book.

Pg10 (Marks or ICA) - ICA stands for internal commulative assessments. So in this page the users marks are displayed according to the semester he/she is in and it shows the marks he/she has scored and how much was it out of. Additinally theres a button raise query which helps the user to ask any query they have regaring the marks he/she has got.

Pg11 (Assignments) - This is the page where users get their assignments. There are 2 dropdowns on this page i.e. Select Subject on which once the user selects the subject from the dropdown, the user gets an interative bar graph which display the assignments which are submitted on time, pending, submitted late and rejected. Then theres the second dropdown from which user can select an assignment and perform 3 actions - download, upload and submit.

Pg12 (News/Updates) - This page shows the news or updates of the college. There is a dropdown on this page i.e. sort by this down has 3 options - sort by date, sort by course and sort by importance. Once the user selects by which one of the three he/she has to sort, the news/updates are sorted according to the dropdown they have selected.

Pg13 (Attendance) - This is the page where users or students can see their attendance. Attendance is displayed subject wise and in percentage. This page also has a raise query button as it was there in marks page.

Pg14 (Profile) - This is the user profile page i.e. the page where user can view and update his/her profile. It has 3 buttons - Change profile photo, change contact number and update. In change profile photo the user gets 2 options- one in which the user can take a photo and the other in which the user can select an exsisting photo. These options take user to camera app and file manager app respectively from where the user gets an button to update their photo. Then theres update phone number in which the user can type his/her new phone number and on entering that they get a update button to update their phone number.

Pg 15 (Admission) - This is the page from which the user can submit an appliction to take admission in the college. There are 2 dropdowns in this page - Select Course which displays the courses offered by the college for example B. Tech Integrated, B. Tech, MBA. Tech, etc. Then after selecting that theres another dropdown of Type which shows the type of streams in that field for eg. comps, data science, ai, etc. Last but not the least theres a sumbit button which submits the application and displays a message to the user.

NOTE:
I had planned to make an UX FLOW CHART for the admin app which whould do control tasks such as uploading assigments, marking attendance, posting news/updates, etc. too but due to time constraints i couldn't do so :(
